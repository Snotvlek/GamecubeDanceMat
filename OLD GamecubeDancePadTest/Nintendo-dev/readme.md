Arduino Nintendo Library
========================
**It is possible that the new 1.5.7 IDE is incompatible because of the new toolchain and different timings.
Everything below (1.0.5 and 1.5.6-r2 works)**

This library is made to connect Nintendo Controllers to your Arduino very easy.
Make sure you grab the right hardware, tear off some cables and use your controllers
on your PC for example. This requires a 16MHZ Arduino.

**The library supports the following devices:**
* Gamecube Controller
* Gamecube Host(todo)
* N64 Controller (todo)
* N64 Host(todo)

**These examples come with the library:**
* Gamecube_Print prints GC controller status to your Serial
* Gamecube_USB_HID makes your GC controller usable on pc. Requires [HID Project](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID).

**These features are planned (Wii stuff with USB Host shield or I2C):**
* Wii-Mote
* Wii Nunchuk
* Wii Classic Controller
* Wii-Mote plus
* Wiiu Pro Controller
* SNES Controller (I dont have any right now)

Gamecube Controller Setup
=========================

The Gamecube controller uses 3.3V Logic, 3.3V Power and 5V rumble Power.
**Make sure to use a logic level converter to not burn your controller.**
A 1k resistor on the 3.3V side is recommended to pullup the line. See schematic.

You better get an extension cable and cut it half. I used a lioncast cable and the colors were:
**Colors of my extension cable, can be different to yours!**
See folder development for more information/links below
```
1 Yellow: 5V
2 White:  Data
3 Red:    Gnd
4 Brown:  Gnd
5 Green:  NC
6 Blue:   3.3V
7 Black:  Gnd
 ```

How does it work
================
Gamecube:
---------
Here is just refer to the other documentations, its explained pretty good.
What i did was to mess around with this some more and integrated easy user access.
This wouldnt be possible without the work of other people (below) and a logic analyzer.
Gamecube tested about 60minutes with 2 reading errors (of some million). Should work stable.

How to get assembler output:
```
 E:\Arduino\arduino-1.5.6-r2\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avr-objdump -S C:\Users\Testuser\AppData\Local\Temp\build8182289464639461553.tmp\GamecubeController13.cpp.elf > E:\RCChannels.dmp
```

I noticed that the timings differ from the controller to the console (black v1):

Gamecube controller pulses: 1uS and 3uS

Gamecube console pulses: 1.25uS and 3.75uS


This library wouldnt be possible without

Known Bugs
==========
**This might not work with newer IDE versions or different compilers (for Gamecube/N64).**
This is because of the very critical timing and the inline assembler with nops.
Arduino IDE 1.0.5 and 1.5.6-r2 do work!

Ports next to the input can crosstalk maybe. This should be 0.2uS or so, not really important.
But this is a general hardware bug of the AVR uCs. Just want to note that.

Version History
