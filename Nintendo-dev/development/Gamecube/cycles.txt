.L1
 some setup instructions
 2 cycles inner loop setup?
 
.L2 - top of outer loop body
 1 cycles to initialize inner loop (loads Z into r18 and 7 into r19)


.L3 - Inner loop body
 5 cycles to lower the line
 8 cycles for condition setup
  2 cycles for 1 bit condition, continue below - bit is 1
  3 cycles for 0 bit, and jump to .L4 - bit is 0

.LM8 - Bit is a 1: low for 1us, high for 3us
 * nop block 1: 1 nops
 5 cycles to raise the line
 * nop block 2: 30 nops
 2 cycles to jump to .L5 - end of conditional branch


.L4 - Bit is a 0: low for 3us, high for 1us
 * nop block 3: 32 cycles
 5 cycles to raise the line, continue below


.L5 - end of conditional branch - line needs to stay high for 16 more cycles
 1 cycle to subtract 1 from r19
  1 cycle to continue below
  2 cycles to jump to .L6 - end of outer loop body

 * nop block 4: 2 nops
 2 cycles to load r24 into Y
 1 cycle to rotate bits of r24
 2 cycles to store Y into r24
 2 cycles to jump to .L3 - top of inner loop body

.L6 - end of outer loop body
 //2 cycles to save r18 into Z (unnecessary)
 1 cycle to subtract 1 from r20 (must be length)
  1 cycle to continue below
  2 cycles to go to .L7 and exit the loop

 2 cycles to add 1 to r30 (Z pointer)
  * nop block 5: 1 nop
 2 cycles to jump to .L2 - top of outer loop bodys

.L7 - end of loops, send a stop bit (1uS low, 3uS high)
 * nop block 6: 5 nop
 5 cycles to bring the line low
 * nop block 7: 11 nops
 5 cycles to bring the line high
 //* nop block 8: 43 nops
 //5 cycles to bring the line low

//from here ive no idea why my counting is wrong.
//fact is its working and the minimum space between every
//measure is 3uS which is perfect.
 
 5 cycles to set Port to in
 5 cycles to enable Pullup
 4 cycles to move stuff
 2 cycles mov, ldi
 
.L8
 1 cycle ldi
 2 cycle to jump to L9
 
.L9 while port is high, increase timeout
 7 cycles to do stuff (3 for loading the state)?
  1 cycle to jump to L10 (if line is LOW)
  2 cycles to continue below
  
 timeout-- if timeout
 1 cycle to substract
  2 cycle to return function
  1 cycles to jump to L9 (check again)
  
.L10 line is low, wait and save value
 *nop block: 12 nops (wait 2uS)
 5 cycles to store value (2 for loading the actual value)
 1 cycle to subtract buffer
  1 cycle to continue below
  2 cycles to return function
   
 1 cycle to add buffer
 *nop block: 10 nops (wait 1,5uS)
 2 cycles to jump to L8
